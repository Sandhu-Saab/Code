This asset folder includes the files related to styling like logos, global.css, or non-js files

What I mean for non-js files:
    - Files that you want to style and use for your whole project like global.css and logos
    - DO NOT include small .css files that tie to other components here
        Note: All the styling currently is done directly into the files itselfs
    

Other than that, this assets folder should not be change (for now)
